# # Simple EDA: difference in distribution between train and test
# I tried that because if the variable's distribution is different, I should get some preprocessing or remove that var. (for LB score improvements)  
# Let me get to the point, I can't find difference in any variables.  
# Sorry for simple content.. I hope it helps someone. Thanks for watching.


# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
print(os.listdir("../input"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
