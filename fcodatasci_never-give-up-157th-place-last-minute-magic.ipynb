I tried different things, from feature interactions to ARIMA, from counts of positives and negatives to fourier coefficient, nothing seemed to work. At one point i said in the forum that I did not think i could get into the bronze medal range (being this my first kaggle competition) but that it was worth following the competition becouse of the great kernels and discussions posted from all of you... (so much to learn!!)\n\nBut I did not give up and kept trying new stuff untill the end... since there were so many hints in the forum, I knew the magic has to be on value counts... in employing the frequency is some way. Finally, with just a few hours to competition deadline, I managed to get into silver range (157th place).
