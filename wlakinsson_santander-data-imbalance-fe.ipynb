His ***main trick*** is using NN (Nearest Neighbours) for feature engineering. Also he noted that feature scaling severely decreases score!!!\n\n[Nanashi](https://www.kaggle.com/jesucristo/santander-magic-lgb-0-901) did some data augmenation - copying once negative, twice positive (t=2). He also has parameter, which gives number of positive copies and t//2 less negative once.\n\n[OIe](https://www.kaggle.com/omgrodas/lightgbm-with-data-augmentation) did very simple data augmentation - just randomly coping positive targets 2 times...\n\nIn [this blog](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/03/imbalanced-classification-problem/), a guy mentions K-Means clustering for data oversampling. I found [kmeans-smote](https://pypi.org/project/kmeans-smote/) library for that.\n\n[Zichen's blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/practical-tips-for-class-imbalance-in-binary-classification-6ee29bcdb8a7) has some more details on handling imbalanced data. There is whole library for them - [imbalanced-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/imbalanced-learn). He also gives some up/down-sampling algorithm with RandomForest. Also he says that ROC is nor the best metrics in this case...\n\nAdditional good model beside Gboosts and NN is SVM. Also look what did TPOT and other AutoML found!"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.\n\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors\nfrom numba import jit","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Read in features from GitHub\ntrain_data = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ntest_data = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\nsample_submission = pd.read_csv('../input/sample_submission.csv')\n\nprint('Training data shape: ', train_data.shape)\nprint('Testing data shape:  ', test_data.shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":false,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_data.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1 Feature Engineering\n## Stat-features by [Gabriel](https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/santander-eda-and-prediction)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\nidx = features = train_data.columns.values[2:202]\nfor df in [test_data, train_data]:\n    df['sum'] = df[idx].sum(axis=1)  \n    df['min'] = df[idx].min(axis=1)\n    df['max'] = df[idx].max(axis=1)\n    df['mean'] = df[idx].mean(axis=1)\n    df['std'] = df[idx].std(axis=1)\n    df['skew'] = df[idx].skew(axis=1)\n    df['kurt'] = df[idx].kurtosis(axis=1)\n    df['med'] = df[idx].median(axis=1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_data[train_data.columns[202:]].head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Nearest Neighbor by [Andrew](https://www.kaggle.com/artgor/santander-eda-fe-fs-and-models/data)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\nX = train_data.drop(['ID_code', 'target'], axis=1)\nX_test = test_data.drop(['ID_code'], axis=1)\nneigh = NearestNeighbors(4, n_jobs=-1)\nneigh.fit(X)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\n\ndists, _ = neigh.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=4)\nmean_dist = dists.mean(axis=1)\nmax_dist = dists.max(axis=1)\nmin_dist = dists.min(axis=1)\n\ntrain_data['mean_dist_4'] = mean_dist\ntrain_data['max_dist_4'] = max_dist\ntrain_data['min_dist_4'] = min_dist","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\n\ntest_dists, _ = neigh.kneighbors(X_test, n_neighbors=3)\ntest_mean_dist = test_dists.mean(axis=1)\ntest_max_dist = test_dists.max(axis=1)\ntest_min_dist = test_dists.min(axis=1)\n\ntest_data['mean_dist_4'] = test_mean_dist\ntest_data['max_dist_4'] = test_max_dist\ntest_data['min_dist_4'] = test_min_dist","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_data[train_data.columns[210:]].head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_data.to_csv('train_milos4.csv', index=False)\ntest_data.to_csv('test_milos4.csv', index=False)\nsample_submission.to_csv('sample_submission.csv', index=False)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('Training data shape: ', train_data.shape)\nprint('Testing data shape:  ', test_data.shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
