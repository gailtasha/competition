{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Hi everyone! \n\nHere is another take on trying to get the most out of the data when the features are assumed to be independent. The idea is to fit 200 classifiers, each using only one of the features, and then combining the predictions using Bayes' rule as in Naive Bayes methods. I've previously experimented by using kernel density estimates to obtain the individual classifiers as in Chris Deotte's kernel [here](http://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/modified-naive-bayes-santander-0-899), but achieved better results when the individual classifiers where gradient boosted trees. Enjoy!"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport lightgbm as lgb\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/train.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# LightGBM parameters found manually. \n# I picked one feature (var_12) and tuned the parameters only on that feature. \n# I tried to keep n_iterations fairly low (~600) while still achieving good results.\nparams = {\n    'boosting':'gbdt', \n    'bagging_freq':5,\n    'bagging_fraction':0.5, # important for creating fairly smooth prediction functions.\n                # without bagging, tree splits always happens at the same 1023 places and\n                # the result is a very \"rugged\" function\n    'num_leaves':2,\n    'reg_lambda':100.0,\n    'learning_rate':0.01, \n    'max_bin':1023, # seems to allow fitting the tails better when using more bins\n    'seed':3366\n}","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"One could of course try to tune the LGBM parameters for each feature individually, but that's just too tedious.
