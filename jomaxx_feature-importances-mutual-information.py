# ## Setup environment and load data


# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.feature_selection import mutual_info_classif, f_classif

print(os.listdir("../input"))

%matplotlib inline
# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.


train = pd.read_csv("../input/train.csv")


train.head()


# ## 2. Feature Engeneering and Importances


feature_columns = train.columns[2:]
target_column = train.columns[1:2]


X = train[feature_columns]
y = train[target_column]


# ### Distribution of target


plt.figure(figsize=(16,8))
ax = sns.countplot(x='target', data=train)


mic = mutual_info_classif(X.values, y.values.ravel())


feature_importances = {}
for i,f in enumerate(feature_columns):
    feature_importances[f] = mic[i] 


sorted(feature_importances.items(), key=lambda kv: kv[1], reverse=True)
