# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
print(os.listdir("../input/multiple-data-nn"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.


submission = pd.read_csv("../input/multiple-data-nn/submission__nn__0.9005821511281362.csv")


submission.head()


submission['target'] = submission['target'] * 12 /8


submission.head()


submission.to_csv('output.csv',index=False)
