So we use gradient decent to learn these weights. For the purpose of eliminating useless feautures, **Lasso(L1-norm)** are used in the linear model. Also, **ReLU** are applied on the weights to make sure that weights either positive(>0) or sparse(=0).   \n\nOur Lasso Weighted Naive Bayes model use back-prop&gradient decent to shrikage the weights. And the experiment shows that our model is **expert** in eliminating these useless features by itself.  By tuning the lambda of L1-norm from 2e-5 to 4e-5, at last we are able to gain almost **same level of AUC using only 50% of the features, which actually indicate that around half of the features are not informative (I prefer saying \"almost useless\") for our prediction.  ** Further analysis show that the feature selection process could be possibly applied to  LGB model.\n\n-------\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"*I would be happy if my post help you understand NB or the data better.*   \nGive me a **thumb up or follow** if this kernel is helpful to you.
