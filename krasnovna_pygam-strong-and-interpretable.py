# GAM is very good choice when we want get some strong and interpretable solution.
# It catches and shows carefully nonlinearity between dependent variable( in our case it is binary target ) and predictors.
# For binary case logit function uses as a link function to predictors.
# 
# Here is a good link to read more carefully about this approach:
# https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/07/30/gam/
# 
# In the below cells I will briefly show simple solution based on python library PyGam. 
# 
# p.s. Internet has to be turned on for installing Pygam package.

# Simple "toy" Model ~ 20 minutes ( 4 folds from the beginning( to calc cross_val ROC), 2 bags in each fold + 1 random set of 50 variables( 8 models )). number of splines and lam are default ) It is possible to play with these parameters like we do it in different "trees" examples.. Sometimes you need make your train sample a bit little to fit it in yout RAM memory.

# Test probabilities was highly correlated with output of LGBM, less correlation was with Naive Bayes & NN models.
