# Because the dataset is anonymized I thought about doing this. 


# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import seaborn as sns
# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
print(os.listdir("../input"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.


train = pd.read_csv("../input/train.csv")
test = pd.read_csv("../input/test.csv")


# Distribution of *var_81* in train datset.


sns.distplot(train["var_81"], bins=100)


# Now lets do some math :)


train["age"] = train["var_81"]*(np.log(2*train["var_81"]))
print("min value " + str(min(train["age"])))
print("max value " + str(max(train["age"])))


sns.distplot(train["age"], bins=100)


# Now lets look at the test data


test["age"] = test["var_81"]*(np.log(2*test["var_81"]))
print("min value " + str(min(test["age"])))
print("max value " + str(max(test["age"])))


sns.distplot(test["age"], bins=100)


# Could it be that *var_81* is the age feature?
